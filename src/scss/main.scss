/**
 * 1. Abstract
 *
 * The abstracts/ folder gathers all Sass tools and helpers used across the
 * project. Every global variable, function, mixin and placeholder should be
 * put in here.
 * The rule of thumb for this folder is that it should not output a single line
 * of CSS when compiled on its own. These are nothing but Sass helpers.

/**
 * 2. Vendors
 *
 * Most projects will have a vendors/ folder containing all the CSS files from
 * external libraries and frameworks – Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI,
 * FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered, and so on. Putting those aside in the same
 * folder is a good way to say “Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my
 * responsibility”.

/**
 * 3. Base
 *
 * The base/ folder holds what we might call the boilerplate code for the
 * project.
 *
 * If your project uses a lot of CSS animations, you might consider
 * adding an \_animations.scss file in there containing the @keyframes
 * definitions of all your animations. If you only use a them sporadically,
 * let them live along the selectors that use them.

/**
 * 4. Layout
 *
 * The layout/ folder contains everything that takes part in laying out the
 * site or application. This folder could have stylesheets for the main parts
 * of the site (header, footer, navigation, sidebar…), the grid system or even
 * CSS styles for all the forms.

/**
 * 5. Components
 *
 * For smaller components, there is the components/ folder. While layout/ is
 * macro (defining the global wireframe), components/ is more focused on
 * widgets. It contains all kind of specific modules like a slider, a loader, a
 * widget, and basically anything along those lines. There are usually a lot of
 * files in components/ since the whole site/application should be mostly
 * composed of tiny modules.
